# payslip_task
This this basic payslip generator
Run : ` python cli.py` . Enter the data required and your payslip will be generated

Some Notes:

1. The Date entered only calculates the payslip based on start date. It does not do prorata
2. The application firmly setup for 30 days (it does not handle 28,29 and 31 days
3. It is rounding to whole number (i believe it't noe exactly round down or up)
4. etc (I will update accordingly)
